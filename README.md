With aesthetic music player, you can enter a URL from either Soundcloud or YouTube and play it via the onscreen player (without additional video streaming, in YouTube's case).



## Tech stack:

React is used for the frontend. The backend consists of a GraphQL engine deployed by Hasura, and interacted with via Apollo-client. The database used is Neon (postgres).
Styling is applied via Material UI.

## Functionality:

With the music player, you can enter any YouTube or Soundcloud URL and save the information to the database. You can then create a listening queue to suit your mood.
The songs in the queue are saved in local storage, so you won't lose your playlist. 

## Challenges:
